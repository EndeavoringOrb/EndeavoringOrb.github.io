“The Game” is a game I am working on which aims to use integrated AI image generation and AI text generation to provide a more immersive game experience.

Concepts Used:  
- Image Generation
- Text Generation
- Threading
- OOP

What is "The Game"?
-----
The sentiment behind this game is “How cool would it be to have a game that combines the storytelling and flexibility of choice from a tabletop game like Dungeons & Dragons with the awesome graphics and action of a video game!”. The entire world is built from a world description written by the player at the beginning of the game. I am working with a mix of Python and C++, C++ for the game and Python for the AI elements. The game will be a top-down RPG with a pixel art style.

What's Next?
-----
Finishing the implementation of conversation between the player and NPCs, then its on to world generation (towns, npcs, dungeons, overworld etc.) and making sure that this graphical world generation works together with the text-based world generation that is already in place.
