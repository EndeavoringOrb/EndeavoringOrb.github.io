What is Mage Madness?
-----
Mage Madness is the second game I have been working on. It is a more traditional game, a pixel-art rpg where you play as a mage fighting through arenas. I am using it to further my C++ and general game dev skills before tackling big features in [“The Game”](./the_game.md). This project will also allow me to expand the game engine I am creating for [“The Game”](./the_game.md). I am trying to make this game as complete as possible, so I am also writing a storyline and composing music to go along with the game.

What's Next?
-----
Implementing enemy AI, cutscenes, some skills, and leveling.
